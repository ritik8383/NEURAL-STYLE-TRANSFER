# Description
Neural Style Transfer (NST) model. This task focuses on a fascinating application of artificial intelligence and deep learning, where the objective is to merge the content of one image with the artistic style of another. The result is a new image that retains the core structure of the original but is visually transformed to appear as though it was created in the style of a chosen artwork.
What is Neural Style Transfer?
Neural Style Transfer is a technique in the field of computer vision and deep learning that uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to apply the artistic style of one image (like a painting) onto another image (like a photograph). It works by extracting the content features of the base image and the style features from the reference artwork. Then it blends these features to produce an output image that combines the content of the base image with the artistic appearance of the style image.
Objective of Task 3
The main objective is to design and implement a Python script or Jupyter notebook that demonstrates how Neural Style Transfer can be applied. Interns are expected to create a functional system where users can input a content image (like a normal photograph) and a style image (like a painting) and receive a new image that reflects the artistic style on the content image.
Deliverables
A fully functional Python script or notebook.
The script should showcase:
Selection of a content image.
Selection of a style image.
Generation of a stylized image.
Examples of input images and the resulting styled images should be included.
Tools and Technologies
Python Programming Language
Deep Learning Libraries like:
TensorFlow or PyTorch
OpenCV (for image processing)
Matplotlib (for displaying images)
Pre-trained CNN models, typically VGG19, are commonly used because of their ability to extract high-level features from images effectively.
How Neural Style Transfer Works
Feature Extraction:
Use a pre-trained CNN (usually VGG19) to extract content features from the content image and style features from the style image.
Content Representation:
The content image representation focuses on the high-level structure, objects, and layout in the image.
Style Representation:
The style is captured by computing the correlations between different filter responses (i.e., Gram matrices) from different layers of the CNN.
Loss Calculation:
The content loss measures the difference between the content of the generated image and the original content image.
The style loss measures how well the style of the generated image matches the style image.
The total loss is a weighted sum of content and style losses.
Optimization:
Start with a copy of the content image (or a noise image) and iteratively update it to minimize the total loss using optimizers like Adam or L-BFGS.
Output:
The result is a new image that looks like the content image painted in the style of the chosen artwork.
Applications
Neural Style Transfer is widely used in:
Artistic photo editing.
Social media filters.
Graphic design.
Creative industries to generate new art forms.
